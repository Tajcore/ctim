# Unit Tests for Admin Functionality

**General Admin Tests:**

- Test that the admin interface loads correctly for each model.
- Test that the list views display the correct fields for each model.
- Test that the detail views (add/edit forms) display the correct fields for each model.

**ToolRegistryAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can add a new tool registry entry via the admin interface.
- Test that an admin user can edit an existing tool registry entry.
- Test that the search functionality works correctly, filtering tool registry entries based on name, module path, and method name.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each tool registry entry.
- Test that attempting to save an invalid tool registry entry (e.g., incorrect module path) results in an appropriate error message.

**ToolAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can add a new tool instance via the admin interface.
- Test that an admin user can edit an existing tool instance.
- Test that the search functionality works correctly, filtering tool instances based on the associated tool registry name.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each tool instance.
- Test that attempting to save an invalid tool instance (e.g., linking to a non-existent tool registry) results in an appropriate error message.

**AgentAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can add a new agent via the admin interface.
- Test that an admin user can edit an existing agent.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each agent, including role, goal, and timestamps.
- Test that the detail view allows selection and association of multiple tools.
- Test that attempting to save an invalid agent entry (e.g., missing required fields) results in an appropriate error message.

**TaskAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can add a new task via the admin interface.
- Test that an admin user can edit an existing task.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each task, including description, status, agent, and timestamps.
- Test that the detail view allows selection and association of multiple tools.
- Test that attempting to save an invalid task entry (e.g., missing required fields) results in an appropriate error message.

**CrewAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can add a new crew via the admin interface.
- Test that an admin user can edit an existing crew.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each crew, including ID, status, and timestamps.
- Test that the detail view allows selection and association of multiple agents and tasks.
- Test that the custom action "Kick off selected crew tasks" works as expected, displaying the appropriate success message.

**ExecutionResultAdmin Tests:**

- Test that an admin user can view execution results in the admin interface.
- Test that the list view shows the correct details for each execution result, including crew, timestamp, and status.
- Test that the detail view displays the correct information for each execution result.

**Edge Case and Error Handling Tests:**

- Test adding, editing, and deleting entries with edge case values (e.g., very long strings).
- Test that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs.
- Test that the system gracefully handles attempts to link non-existent entities (e.g., associating a task with a non-existent agent).

By covering these tests, you can ensure that the admin functionality is robust, user-friendly, and handles both typical and edge case scenarios correctly.
